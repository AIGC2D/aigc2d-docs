# Frequently Asked Questions

- Billing Explanation
  - AIGC2D is billed using tokens. When making a request to the API, an estimated number of tokens (calculated based on max_tokens) will be frozen. After the request is completed, the actual number of tokens consumed will be calculated, and any excess tokens will be refunded or any shortfall will be charged accordingly.
  - The minimum token consumption per request is 0.01.
  - Tokens can be obtained through recharging or inviting new users to recharge.
  - Refunds are not supported for this service. It is recommended to make a small purchase for testing purposes.

- Do you collect OpenAI dialogue data?
> Please rest assured that the platform does not collect your dialogue record data. We only record the number of tokens consumed for each request.

- Why doesn't GPT-4 know that it is GPT-4?
> This is because the OpenAI knowledge base has not been updated, and the training data is still up to 2021. Therefore, it still considers itself as GPT-3.
