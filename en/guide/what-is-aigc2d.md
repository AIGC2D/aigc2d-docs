# What is AIGC2D

AIGC (AI Generated Content) is an advanced technology that uses artificial intelligence to generate various types of content. This content includes (but is not limited to) AI text generation, AI image generation, AI hosts, etc. To meet the needs of developers, the AIGC2D (AI-Generated Content To Developer) platform was created, which provides developers with a variety of AIGC interfaces.

On the AIGC2D platform, developers can easily access the following famous AIGC interfaces:

- **OpenAI**
- **Midjourney**
- **Stable Diffusion**
- **Wenxin Large Model**
- ...

Through the AIGC2D platform, developers can more easily obtain these AIGC interfaces, thereby reducing development difficulties, improving productivity, and applying artificial intelligence technology to various fields and application scenarios.

## Our Vision

Our goal is to enable developers to easily build professional and specialized business applications based on global high-quality AI model capabilities. At the same time, we also hope that all users can use AI services quickly, stably, and securely.

## Developers

Our platform is dedicated to helping developers worldwide quickly build applications based on mature AI models. You no longer need to worry about billing, account management, traffic restrictions, model interface access stability, and other API management tasks. You only need to focus on your business scenario development and how to use AI capabilities.

## General Users

The large language model (LLM) capability of OpenAI has rekindled people's confidence in AI and injected new vitality into the software field. I personally believe that with the help of AI capabilities, all application software we use on PCs and mobile Internet will be redesigned in the future. The way of human-computer interaction will also undergo profound changes because LLM can understand the natural language characteristics of humans. In this context, and under the leadership of OpenAI, the short-term form of AI applications will definitely be lightweight "endpoints". Each user only needs to obtain your own paid API key from OpenAI to use this application endpoint. AIGC2D will help you connect to OpenAI and make it easy for you to obtain usage permissions.

## Responsible Use of Generative AI

Due to the characteristics of generative AI, its control measures may vary in different countries. All users must comply with the relevant laws of their country. Our platform strictly prohibits the use of APIs to directly provide product services to users in mainland China. All interfaces of this platform are only allowed for individual or team product prototype development, proof of concept (PoC), personal testing, and experimental learning applications.

If you are an enterprise customer and still wish to use our platform capabilities to provide services to users in the Chinese region after the product prototype verification stage, please contact us. We will provide you with professional technical solution consulting and independent deployment services.

Disclaimer: Any use that violates the acceptable use policy of AI Proxy, including but not limited to any use prohibited by laws, regulations, government orders, or ordinances, or any use that infringes on the rights of others, is the responsibility of the user. We are not responsible for any problems caused by customer use. 

## Content Requirements

We prohibit the generation of content using our model service that may cause harm to individuals or society. Ensuring the security of the platform is crucial for long-term stable operation. If any violation of generating and using inappropriate content is found using the platform's model capabilities, the account will be immediately banned and the points balance will not be refunded.

- Exploitation and abuse
